# heartbeat
my very first company website

## introduction

I will not improve or review, It served as html/css/js training and grounds for implementation of things learnt.

## getting started

### installation

perform a

```git
git clone https://github.com/kevinMudenge/doodles.git

```

allow installation, navigate into the HTML | CSS/heartbeat folder, voila! Heart. üòÅ

### run

to run, I run with Live Server, an extension in vlc code(I like it for a lot of reasons)

click on Go Live

alternatively you can just click on the indx.html file, it will open in your browser.

## features

hover effects, scrollEffects, applied working links and I believe aesthetics, colour palette, etcetera, explore see if you find them all.


Lovely Day.
