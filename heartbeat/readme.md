I will not improve or review, It served as html/css/js training and grounds for implementation of things learnt.

## languages

HTML, CSS, JS

## getting started

perform a

```git
git clone https://github.com/kevinMudenge/doodles.git

to run, I run with Live Server, an extension in vlc code(I like it for a lot of reasons)

click on Go Live

alternatively you can just click on the index.html file, it will open in your browser.

## features

hover effects, scrollEffects, applied working links and I believe aesthetics, colour palette, etcetera, explore see if you find them all.


Lovely Day.
