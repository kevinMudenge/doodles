# Simple Implementations | Kwest Entry form iteration

## Introduction

I built a version of my own kwest input entry form, the dashboard topbar used is a thought a process for an app I have going on

It is not yet done, working progress, still figuring out the ins and outs and placement of future projects.

## Languages

React.Js, Material Ui (styling and pre-built componentsðŸ™‚)

## Getting Started

### Installation and Running

perform a

```git
git clone https://github.com/kevinMudenge/doodles.git

```

allow installation, I put working thoughts under doodles so if not interested in html, ignore and proceed to random-react-components and run

```bash | npm
cd doodles //parent folder
cd random-react-components
npm i //install dependencies

npm start

```

## Features

Togle dark and light mode
MUI Material Switch Implementation(finally, that was hard), toggles dark and light mode too.

Interactive Buttons, Basic UI/UX

Dynamic rendering of elements per clicks

Responsive design(md is annoying but scales fine from lg to xs, md is annoying, considering)
