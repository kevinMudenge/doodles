# Simple Implementations | Kwest Entry form iteration

## Introduction

I built a version of my own kwest input entry form, the dashboard topbar used is a thought process for an app entry point I have going on, probably the whole thing,

The button drops you to a kwest registration thing, I have no affiliates just promoting, just is.

### Possible changelog

Form data(hiring services network take-over) extends -> build with material ui
    registration form...
    some client search, client filled entry thing

The images and placing side by side in one box. and another for the copyright, one line, heart. 20...


## Languages

React.Js, Material Ui (styling and pre-built componentsðŸ™‚)

## Getting Started

### Installation and Running

perform a

```git
git clone https://github.com/kevinMudenge/doodles.git

```

allow installation, I put working thoughts under doodles so if not interested in html, ignore and proceed to react-components and run

```bash | npm
cd doodles //parent folder
cd react-components
npm i //install dependencies

npm start

```

## Features

Togle dark and light mode
MUI Material Switch Implementation(finally, that was hard), toggles dark and light mode too.

Interactive Buttons, Basic UI/UX

Dynamic rendering of elements per clicks

Responsive design(md is annoying but scales fine from lg to xs, md is annoying, considering)
