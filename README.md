# doodles

This repo carries all my thoughts and pre-built components

Current projects:
- heartbeat

    a html|css presemtational website for my company ideas/ portfolio version 0.1.
    I will not update anyhting here honestly.
- what'sweather

    a javascript extensive basic weather app implementation with openweather.org api for weather data.
- react-components 

    they are organized as a working site but each component is just a separate entity and thought process, currently this folder contains:
        
 - TopBarThoughts.jsx(in global)
 - kwestinputform(in scenes)
  - index.jsx

open each individual doodle(s) as standalone, they are not alike

```cd "projectName" 

//where projectName = projectName of the doodle you want.
